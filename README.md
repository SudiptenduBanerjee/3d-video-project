# 3D Video Generation with Python and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a 3D video using Python, leveraging libraries like `matplotlib` for 3D visualization and `opencv-python` for video processing. The video features a rotating 3D cube, generated in a Kaggle notebook environment. The project showcases basic 3D animation techniques and provides a foundation for incorporating machine learning models, such as TripoSR, for advanced 3D model generation from 2D images. The code is designed to run seamlessly on Kaggle and is version-controlled on GitHub for collaboration and sharing.

## Features
- Generates a 3D rotating cube animation using `matplotlib`.
- Compiles animation frames into a video file (`3d_cube_video.mp4`) using `opencv-python`.
- Optimized for Kaggle’s notebook environment with minimal dependencies.
- Includes optional guidance for integrating machine learning with TripoSR for 3D model generation.
- Versioned on GitHub with a clear workflow for reproducibility.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following:
- A [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) account with a verified phone number (for GPU access, if needed).
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account for version control.
- Basic familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Required Python Libraries
- `matplotlib` - For 3D plotting and visualization.
- `numpy` - For numerical computations.
- `opencv-python` - For video processing.
- (Optional) `torch`, `torchvision`, `triposr` - For machine learning-based 3D model generation.

These libraries are installed automatically in the Kaggle notebook (see [Usage](#usage)).

## Installation
1. **Set Up Kaggle Notebook**:
   - Log in to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and create a new notebook (`Code` > `New Notebook`).
   - Ensure the language is set to Python in the notebook settings.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Add and run the following code in a notebook cell to install required libraries:
     ```bash
     !pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
     ```
   - For machine learning enhancements (optional, requires GPU):
     ```bash
     !pip install torch torchvision
     !pip install git+https://github.com/stability-AI/triposr.git
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository** (optional, for local development):
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-video-project.git
     cd 3d-video-project
     ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the Kaggle notebook (`3d_cube_animation.ipynb`) from this repository or create a new one.
   - Copy and paste the code from `3d_cube_animation.py` (available in this repository) into the notebook.
   - Run all cells sequentially to:
     - Generate 100 frames of a rotating 3D cube.
     - Compile frames into a video (`/kaggle/working/3d_cube_video.mp4`).
   - Download the output video from Kaggle’s “Output” tab.

2. **Optional: Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Upload a 2D image to Kaggle (e.g., `/kaggle/input/your-dataset/image.png`).
   - Use the TripoSR model to generate a 3D mesh (requires GPU and additional setup; see notebook comments for details).
   - Note: TripoSR integration is experimental and may require external tools like Blender for full animation.

3. **View the Output**:
   - The generated video (`3d_cube_video.mp4`) is saved in `/kaggle/working/`.
   - Download and view it locally or share it directly from Kaggle.

## Project Structure
```plaintext
3d-video-project/
├── 3d_cube_animation.ipynb  # Kaggle notebook with the main code
├── 3d_cube_video.mp4       # Output video (generated on Kaggle)
├── README.md               # This file
└── LICENSE                 # MIT License
```

## Pushing to GitHub
1. **Link Kaggle to GitHub**:
   - In the Kaggle notebook, go to `File` > `Link to GitHub` and authorize your GitHub account.
   - Save the notebook to commit it to your repository.

2. **Manually Upload Video**:
   - Download `3d_cube_video.mp4` from Kaggle’s “Output” tab.
   - Add it to your local repository:
     ```bash
     git add 3d_cube_video.mp4
     git commit -m "Add generated 3D video"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Verify**:
   - Check your GitHub repository to ensure the notebook and video are uploaded.

## Example Output
The project generates a video of a rotating 3D cube, saved as `3d_cube_video.mp4`. The animation consists of 100 frames at 30 FPS, showing a blue wireframe cube rotating around the y-axis.

## Limitations
- **Kaggle Constraints**: Limited disk space and memory in Kaggle’s free tier may restrict large-scale animations.
- **TripoSR**: Requires a GPU and a suitable input image. Animation of TripoSR meshes is not fully supported in Kaggle due to rendering limitations.
- **GitHub File Size**: Videos larger than 100MB require Git LFS or external hosting (e.g., Google Drive).
